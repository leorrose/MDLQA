# Naive Bayes

### ***Q1. The goal is to classify image x to one of the two classes A,B. The the priori probabilities are P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.6. The probability of obtaining the above x given A is 0.7 Whereas the probability of obtaining the above x given B is 0.3. According to the Na√Øve Bayess method, the class that must be chosen to minimize the mistake expected value is B.***

- [ ] True
- [x] False

***Explanation*** - P(A|x) = P(A) \* P(x|A) = 0.28, P(B|x) = P(B) \* P(x|B) = 0.18.

### ***Q2. The goal is to classify image x to one of the two classes A,B. The the priori probabilities are P(A) = 0.4, P(B) = 0.6. The probability of obtaining the above x given A is 0.6 Whereas the probability of obtaining the above x given B is 0.5. The class that must be chosen to minimize the mistake expected value is B.***

- [x] True
- [ ] False

***Explanation*** - P(A|x) = P(A) \* P(x|A) = 0.24, P(B|x) = P(B) \* P(x|B) = 0.3.
