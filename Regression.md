# Regression

### ***Q1. True or False: logistic regression is suitable for solving binary classification problems and multi-class problems.***

- [ ] True
- [x] False

***Explanation*** - Logistic regression in its original form is intended for binary classification it can be used for multi-class problems but this requires the classification problem first be transformed into multiple binary classification problems.

### ***Q2. True or False: the Shrinkage method makes it possible to avoid overfitting.***

- [x] True
- [ ] False

***Explanation*** - Regularization (also sometimes called shrinkage) is a technique that prevents the parameters of a model from becoming too large and “shrinks” them toward 0. The result of regularization is models that, when making predictions on new data, have less variance.
